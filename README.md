1. Animated Header
The page opens with a stunning entrance as the header text smoothly slides in from the left to the center. This animation grabs the user's attention right from the start, making the title stand out.
2. Grid of Animations
The main section features a grid layout, where each item showcases a different type of CSS animation:
Fade In/Out: The item fades in and out, demonstrating a smooth transition of opacity.
Slide In: This item slides in from the bottom, adding a sense of motion and direction.
Rotate: A full 360-degree rotation that adds a dynamic spinning effect.
Scale/Zoom: The item scales up and down, creating a zoom-in and zoom-out effect.
Bounce: A playful bounce animation that gives the item a lively feel.
3. Hover Effects
Each grid item also includes a hover effect that scales the item slightly and changes its color dynamically, making the interface more interactive and responsive to user actions.
